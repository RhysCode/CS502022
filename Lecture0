What ultimately matters in this course, is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates, but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.

Computer Science: "The Study of Information"

Input -> [ ] -> Output

Computers use Binary.

Binary Digit = Bit = 0 OR 1

8421
0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0011 = 3
0100 = 4
0101 = 5
0110 = 6
0111 = 7
1000 = 8

42 Minutes on the Y2K Problem

Byte/Octet = Eight Bits

11111111 = 255

Kilobyes = Thousands of Bytes
Megabytes = Millions of Bytes
Gigabytes = Billions of Bytes

A = 65 0 01000001

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): A mapping between numbers, and letters.

Unicode: A mapping between numbers, and letters, for all different languages (including emojis).

RGB (Red, Green, Blue): Every pixel on your screen uses three channels, or three bytes (24 bits), to create a wide assortment of colors on screen. 

Pseudocode
Pseudocode literally means ‘fake code’. It is an informal and contrived way of writing programs in which you represent the sequence of actions and instructions (aka algorithms) in a form that humans can easily understand.

1. Pick up phone book.
2. Open to the middle of the phone book.
3. Look at page.
4. If person is on page
  Call person.
5. Else if person is earlier in book
  Open to middle of left half of book.
  Go back to line 3.
6. Else if person is later in book
  Open to middle of right half of book.
  Go back to line 3.
7. Else
  Quit
  
If, Else If, and Else = Conditions
Person is on Page = Boolean Expression (a True or a False answer, i.e. a 1, or a 0)
Go back to line 3 = Loop
